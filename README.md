## KSP2 Unofficial API

This repo contains all the files necessary to build a GitHub Pages site using DocFX to document the KSP2 Application Programming Interface (API). The documentation is composed of two parts: The auto-generated API documentation based on a stripped version of the game's actual source code, plus various articles that relate to understanding and using this documentation.

**NOTE:** There is no actual source code for the game in this repo. The "source" files are all located in the src_stripped folder and only contain the API information stripped from the game's Assembly-CSharp.dll. From this you can see how to call the functions and methods, but not necessarily how they work.

You can make contributions to the KSP2 Unofficial API documentation by forking this repo and editing the stripped C# files in the src_stripped folder, or by adding/updating articles in the articles folder.
